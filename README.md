# BlinkList

Developed a BlinkList application using the powerful combination of Spring Boot, H2 database, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate. 
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in building a robust web application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

Using Spring Boot, I set up the application quickly, focusing more on business logic rather than tedious configuration. 
The H2 database allowed me to efficiently store and manage task data without the need for external database setups.

Leveraging Spring Data JPA, I seamlessly integrated the database with the application and utilized Hibernate as the ORM framework, 
simplifying data access through object-oriented programming. This combination proved to be a game-changer, enabling me to write efficient and maintainable code.

During development, I harnessed the power of Spring Devtools, which provided automatic restart support, significantly improving my productivity by 
reducing turnaround time on code changes.

Throughout this project, I honed my skills in Java, Spring Boot, and database management. 
I now feel confident in my ability to build scalable and user-friendly applications, and I look forward to taking on more challenging projects in the future.
